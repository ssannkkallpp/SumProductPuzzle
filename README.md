# SumProductPuzzle
C++ code to solve the popular sum and product puzzle. Two individuals interacting know the sum and product respectively of two numbers and a and b. However, they do not know the numbers (a, b) individually. Let's call the one who knows the sum S and the other P(for product). The conversation between the two goes as follows:
S : I do not know the numbers (a, b).
P : I know you do not know the numbers (a, b).
S : Now I know what the numbers are.
P : Now I too know (a,b).

This program computes all possible pairs (a,b) and respective S and P such that a<b<S<=100.
